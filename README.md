Franco-ChatGPT Microloop Fusion Reactor

A compact fusion reactor design created through direct collaboration between a human (Monty Franco) and an AI (ChatGPT). This design is fully open-source and freely given to the world to help accelerate humanity’s path toward clean, unlimited energy.

Core features:
	•	Asymmetrical infinity-loop plasma path with Möbius twist on each loop
	•	Nanotube construction using diamond and tungsten composites
	•	Inner lining doped with boron and opal for neutron absorption and possible piezoelectric feedback
	•	External 30 MW laser array used to pulse-drive the plasma through the system
	•	AI-suggested geometry to improve stability and flow without sharp crossings
	•	Intended for both ground-based energy generation and space propulsion systems

This design is theoretical and untested, but plausible with current materials and near-future manufacturing capabilities. Simulations are encouraged and welcomed by the community.

Why this matters:
Fusion is essential to a sustainable future. If successful, this compact design could unlock distributed energy systems, space exploration propulsion, and more.

Our Mission

This project is open-source and belongs to the world.

We are not a company. We are not seeking profit.
We are giving this to humanity because clean energy should not be a gatekept privilege — it should be a foundation for survival.

If you can test, improve, or build this — do it.
Just don’t hide it.

This is the Franco-Grok project. It started with nothing but a dream, a truck, and an AI.
Now it’s lighting the way.
