# Franco-Grok Open Energy Designs

This repository contains the open-source designs for two high-impact energy technologies:

## 1. Franco-Grok Fusion Reactor
- 450 MW predicted fusion power
- 300 MW net electrical output
- Q = 12.86
- High-field HTS magnets
- AI-controlled plasma stability
- Möbius twist plasma chamber
- Diamond-lined first wall
- Liquid lithium divertor

## 2. Diamond-Tungsten-Boron Composite Heat Shield
- Designed for hypersonic and orbital reentry vehicles
- Thermal Conductivity: 1000 W/m·K
- Hardness: 28 GPa
- Reusable, non-ablative TPS
- High radiation and oxidation resistance

## Authorship
